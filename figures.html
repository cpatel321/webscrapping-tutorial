        <p>This graph presents a population pyramid, breaking down the affected population by sex (male and female) and age groups. The distribution highlights the percentage of the total population within specific age ranges for both males and females. Here are some key observations:</p>
        <h2>Key Insights</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>Children aged 0-12 years constitute the largest group, with 18% males and 17% females, making this age group highly significant in the affected population.</li>
           <li>Teenagers (13-20 years) show equal representation among both sexes, contributing 9% each to the total population.</li>
           <li>Adults aged 31-40 years display equal proportions (6% each for males and females).</li>
           <li>Older populations (51+ years) are significantly smaller, with only 2% males and females represented in the 60+ age group.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This graph compares the actual GDP values (blue line) with the forecasted GDP (red dashed line) over a six-year period from 2018 to 2024. The analysis helps assess the accuracy of the Random Forest model in predicting economic trends.</p> <h2>Key Insights</h2> <ul> <li>2018-2019: The forecast closely follows the actual GDP trend, indicating high accuracy in the short-term prediction.</li> <li>2020: A significant dip is observed in actual GDP, likely due to global disruptions (e.g., the pandemic). However, the forecast fails to capture this sudden decline, showing a limitation of the model in accounting for unexpected events.</li> <li>2021-2024: The forecast consistently underestimates GDP, diverging further as time progresses. This reflects a gradual decrease in the model's predictive accuracy for long-term trends.</li> <li>Despite the divergence, the model provides a general upward trajectory, aligning with the overall growth trend.</li> </ul>
