    "## Introduction to APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) allow different software applications to communicate with each other by defining specific methods and rules for interaction. When it comes to web scraping, APIs are a powerful tool that allows you to programmatically interact with web servers and extract data efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, APIs let us retrieve data from web services without needing to manually scrape HTML pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use APIs for web scraping?\n",
    "- **Efficiency:** APIs provide data in a structured format (e.g., JSON, XML), making it easier to extract relevant information.\n",
    "- **Legality:** Some websites offer official APIs, ensuring that scraping is done within the legal boundaries.\n",
    "- **Rate Limiting and Authentication:** APIs can be used in a more controlled manner, reducing the chances of being blocked for excessive scraping."

    "\n",
    "### 1. Making GET Requests to an API\n",
    "APIs generally provide data through HTTP requests. The most common method used for retrieving data is the **GET** request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by making a simple GET request to an API that returns data in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "# URL of the API\n",
    "api_url = 'https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Send a GET request\n",
    "response = requests.get(api_url)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if the request was successful\n",
    "if response.status_code == 200:\n",
    "    data = response.json()  # Convert JSON response into a dictionary\n",
    "    print(data)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Error:', response.status_code)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code:\n",
    "- `requests.get()` is used to send a GET request to the API.\n",
    "- `response.json()` converts the JSON data into a Python dictionary."

    "### 2. Using API Data for Web Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping with APIs involves fetching structured data, which is much easier to process than raw HTML. We will use an API to retrieve information from a public website and store it in a useful format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider an API that provides news headlines. We will make a GET request to fetch the latest headlines and display them.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import requests\n",
    "\n",
    "# API endpoint for fetching news\n",
    "api_url = 'https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?country=us&apiKey=your_api_key'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Send GET request\n",
    "response = requests.get(api_url)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Check if request is successful\n",
    "if response.status_code == 200:\n",
    "    news_data = response.json()\n",
    "    articles = news_data['articles']\n",
    "    for article in articles:\n",
    "        print(f'Title: {article['title']}')\n",
    "        print(f'Description: {article['description']}')\n",
    "        print(f'URL: {article['url']}')\n",
    "        print('-' * 80)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Error:', response.status_code)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **API Key:** Most APIs require an API key for authentication. This key is usually provided when you register with the API service.\n",
    "- **JSON Parsing:** The response from the API is parsed as JSON and we extract relevant information such as titles, descriptions, and URLs."

    "### 3. Handling Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "Many APIs require authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access data. APIs often use API keys or OAuth tokens for authentication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s an example of how to include an API key in the request header for authentication.\n",

    "    print(data)\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Error:', response.status_code)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "- The API key is sent in the request header using the `Authorization` field.\n",

    "        break\n",
